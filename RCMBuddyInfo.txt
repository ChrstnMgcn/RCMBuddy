Excel Buddy Project Setup Summary (Comprehensive)
This document provides a complete overview of the "Excel Buddy" web application's current state, architecture, file structure, key code components, database setup, and deployment steps using Netlify, GitHub, and Neon (PostgreSQL). It also includes a summary of issues encountered and their resolutions.

1. Project Goal
To provide a web application named "Excel Buddy" focused on Excel file manipulation, data validation, and process automation. Key features include:

User Management: Secure user registration and login.
Multi-Company Support: Allows multiple companies to use the application, with strict data isolation ensuring each company can only access its own data. Multiple users can belong to the same company.
File Management: Users can securely upload, store, list, download, and delete general Excel files and other documents directly within the company_files table in the Neon (PostgreSQL) database.
Data Dictionary Builder: A new tool allowing users to upload Excel/CSV files, extract headers, define custom validation rules for these headers, and save these structured data dictionaries to a separate dedicated database table (data_dictionaries). The original uploaded file is not stored on the server for this process. It also filters out already defined headers when building new dictionaries.
Data Validation Tool: An interactive client-side tool to analyze Excel/CSV files for data quality issues, including integration with saved data dictionaries (from the data_dictionaries table) for custom validation rules.
Clean Data Tool: A client-side tool for basic Excel data cleaning (duplicates, trimming, case standardization).
Deployment: Automated deployment via Netlify, leveraging Netlify Functions for backend logic.
Version Control: GitHub.
2. Core Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS for styling), JavaScript
Backend: Node.js (running as Netlify Functions)
Database: Neon (PostgreSQL) for user data, company data, general uploaded files (company_files table), and structured data dictionaries (data_dictionaries table).
Deployment Platform: Netlify
Version Control: GitHub
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless user sessions.
Password Hashing: bcryptjs.
File Upload Parsing: busboy (Node.js library for multipart/form-data).
Excel Processing (Client-side): xlsx.full.min.js (for Validation Engine analysis, Data Dictionary Builder header extraction, and report generation).
Excel Processing (Backend): exceljs (for Data Cleaner processing).

4. Database Schema
The application uses a PostgreSQL database (Neon) with the following tables:

companies table: Stores information about each client company.

SQL

CREATE TABLE companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
users table: Stores user credentials and links to their company.

SQL

-- Assuming existing users table, alter to add company_id
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT;

-- Optional: If you want to enforce that every user MUST belong to a company
-- ALTER TABLE users
-- ALTER COLUMN company_id SET NOT NULL;
company_files table: Stores metadata and the binary data of general uploaded files (e.g., Excel, CSV documents, not data dictionaries generated by the builder), with strict company and user ownership.

SQL

CREATE TABLE company_files (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- CRUCIAL for data isolation
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    original_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    mimetype VARCHAR(100),
    size_bytes BIGINT,
    file_data BYTEA NOT NULL, -- Stores the actual file content as binary data
    -- is_data_dictionary BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, -- REMOVED/MOVED: Data dictionaries now have their own table
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
data_dictionaries table: NEW. Stores structured data dictionary definitions (validation rules) created by the Data Dictionary Builder. This table is separate from company_files and does not store the original source Excel files.

SQL

CREATE TABLE data_dictionaries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- The user-given name for the data dictionary
    rules_json JSONB NOT NULL, -- Stores the array of validation rules as JSON
    source_headers_json JSONB, -- Stores ALL headers from the original file (optional, for reference)
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Constraint to ensure dictionary names are unique per company
ALTER TABLE data_dictionaries
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_company_dictionary_name UNIQUE (company_id, name);
5. Key Code Components & Their Roles
5.1. netlify.toml
The primary configuration for Netlify deployment. It defines build directories, function paths, and API redirects.

Ini, TOML

[build]
  publish = "public"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200

[[plugins]]
package = "@netlify/plugin-functions-install-core"
5.2. Frontend Pages (public/ and public/tools/)
index.html: Login/Registration page. Handles user authentication.
dashboard.html: The primary user dashboard. Authenticates via JWT, displays user and company information, and provides quick access (tool cards) to the main application features.
tools.html: A secondary page listing all available tools. It provides a more comprehensive overview of tools, including placeholders for those under development.
file-manager.html: Handles uploading, listing, downloading, and deleting general files from the company_files table.
tools/data-cleaner.html: Provides the UI for client-side Excel data cleaning.
tools/validation-engine.html:
Client-side validation using xlsx.full.min.js.
Data Dictionary Selection: Now loads dropdowns from the new list-data-dictionaries.js API.
Loads selected dictionary rules from the new get-data-dictionary.js API.
Applies rules and generates reports.
tools/data-dictionary-builder.html: NEW TOOL.
Provides UI for uploading Excel/CSV files.
Displays extracted headers for rule definition.
Includes a "Validation Type Key" to guide rule creation.
tools/data-dictionary-builder.css: NEW. Custom CSS for the Data Dictionary Builder.
tools/data-dictionary-builder.js: NEW.
Handles client-side Excel/CSV parsing to extract headers.
Dynamically builds the rule definition table.
Filters headers based on rules already existing in previously saved data dictionaries (by fetching them via list-data-dictionaries.js and get-data-dictionary.js).
Collects defined rules and a dictionary name.
Sends data to the new save-data-dictionary.js API.
Allows deleting the currently viewed data dictionary via the new delete-data-dictionary.js API.
5.3. Backend Functions (netlify/functions/)
package.json: Lists Node.js dependencies (e.g., bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, pg, busboy, exceljs).
register.js: Handles user and company registration.
login.js: Handles user login and JWT generation.
protected.js: Verifies JWTs for protected routes.
upload-file.js: Handles general file uploads to the company_files table.
list-files.js: Lists general files from the company_files table.
get-file.js: Retrieves binary data of general files from the company_files table.
delete-file.js: Deletes general files from the company_files table.
clean-excel.js: Backend logic for the Data Cleaner tool.
save-data-dictionary.js: NEW. Authenticated function to save a structured data dictionary (name, rules JSON, source headers JSON) into the new data_dictionaries table.
list-data-dictionaries.js: NEW. Authenticated function to list metadata of data dictionaries from the data_dictionaries table.
get-data-dictionary.js: NEW. Authenticated function to retrieve the full rules_json and source_headers_json for a specific data dictionary from the data_dictionaries table.
delete-data-dictionary.js: NEW. Authenticated function to delete a data dictionary from the data_dictionaries table.
5.4. Data Isolation Strategy (CRUCIAL)
Company ID in JWT: company_id is embedded in the JWT upon successful login.
Backend Enforcement: All backend functions that interact with company-specific data (e.g., upload-file.js, list-files.js, get-file.js, delete-file.js, and all the new data-dictionary- functions) MUST:
Verify the JWT.
Extract the company_id from the decoded JWT.
Include a WHERE company_id = <extracted_company_id> clause in ALL database queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to ensure strict data isolation.
6. Netlify Deployment & Configuration
Environment Variables:
DATABASE_URL: Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string.
JWT_SECRET: Your strong, random secret key. These must be set in Netlify Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment Variables, with "Functions" scope enabled.
Continuous Deployment: Netlify automatically deploys changes pushed to the configured GitHub branch.
Function Bundling: The @netlify/plugin-functions-install-core plugin handles Node.js dependency installation for functions.
7. Common Issues & Troubleshooting
"Network or authentication error: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON": Frontend expecting JSON but received HTML. Usually means backend function was not found or failed to execute. Verify netlify.toml redirects, function paths, and check Netlify deploy logs for function errors.
Functions not showing in Netlify deploy logs: Incorrect folder paths in netlify.toml or missing plugin.
Login fails (username/email): Ensure login.js correctly queries both email and username.
Old filename formatting (JSON string in original_filename of company_files): Old entries might exist. file-manager.html includes defensive parsing. New uploads using upload-file.js should store plain strings.
Data Dictionary Filtering/Validation fails (after refactor):
Possible Cause: Ensure all new data-dictionary- backend functions (save-data-dictionary.js, list-data-dictionaries.js, get-data-dictionary.js, delete-data-dictionary.js) are correctly deployed.
Possible Cause: Verify frontend (data-dictionary-builder.js, validation-engine.js) are using the new API endpoints (/api/list-data-dictionaries, /api/get-data-dictionary, etc.) and correctly handling the JSON responses (no base64 decoding needed for rules_json anymore).
Check Database: Confirm data_dictionaries table has records and their rules_json is valid JSON.
File upload/download/delete (for general files) not working: Check specific function logs (upload-file.js, list-files.js, get-file.js, delete-file.js) for runtime errors. Verify authentication token is sent correctly from frontend.
